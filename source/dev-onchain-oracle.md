# Onchain integration
## Use DutchX as an Oracle
Before starting this guide, you should be already familiar with how to
[Local Development + Truffle](./dev-truffle.html). Please, complete 
that guide first before you start with this one.

Once you know how to create a project that depends on the DutchX, and you know
how to migrate the contracts for local development, you are ready to use the 
contract from our project.

One simple use-case of the DutchX is as an on-chain price oracle.  

**Don't forget to check out the [Price Oracle](https://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/price-oracle.html) section for an explanation of the two different price oracles available.**

Learn how to get the price for any token pair from the DutchX following the 
steps described in this project:
