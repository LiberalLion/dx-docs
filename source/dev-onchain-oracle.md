# Use DutchX as an Oracle
Before starting this guide, you should be already familiar with how to
[Build on top of the DutchX](./dev-truffle.html). Please, complete 
that guide first before you start with this one.

Once you know how to create a project that depends on the DutchX, and you know
how to migrate the contracts for local development, you are ready to use the 
contract from our project.

One simple use-case of the DutchX is as an onchain price oracle. 

Learn how to get the price for any token pair from the DutchX following the 
steps described in this project: [Use DutchX as an Oracle](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/03_onchain-usage-oracle)
