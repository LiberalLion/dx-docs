# Get started: Build on top of the DutchX
We've prepared some examples on how you can build on top of the DutchX.

There's many guides, but we recomend you to start by doing the:
* [Example 01: Basic Web - Deposit](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/01_basic-web-deposit).

## Next steps
Although the way of using the contracts of the 
[Example 01: Basic Web - Deposit](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/01_basic-web-deposit)
works for many projects, others prefer to work using a local node like
`ganache-cli` to speed up the development.

Also, for medium size projects, you'll find yourself doing things that are 
**much easier using truffle** (test, migrations, interaction, sharing contracts,
etc...)

Next step will show you how to create a project from scratch that depends on 
the DutchX NPM Package and migrate all the contracts to a local ganache.
* [Example 02: Truffle Migrate](./dev-truffle.html).
