# Get started
We've prepared some examples that will show you how you can build on top of the DutchX:

## Guide
There's many things you can do, but we recomend you to start by doing the 
[Example 01: Basic Web - Deposit](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/01_basic-web-deposit).

## Next steps
Although this way of using the contracts works for many projects, others prefer
to work using a local node like `ganache-cli` to speed up the development.

Also, for medium size projects, you'll find your self doing things that are 
**much easier using truffle** (test, migrations, interaction, sharing contracts,
etc...)

Next step will show you how to create a project from scratch that depends on 
the DutchX NPM Package and migrate all the contracts to a local ganache.
