# Basic truffle project
This example guide is an example that shows how to create a new project from scratch 
that depends on DutchX and how you can deploy the DutchX contracts in a 
`ganache-cli` local node.

This project is interesting for allowing to deploy easily the contracts in local,
so we don't depend on testnets like Rinkeby and we can speed up the development.

Also truffle has many other advantages that makes easier the development, so it 
should be consider for medium size project.
