The DutchX is an open, decentralized trading protocol for ERC20 tokens using
the Dutch auction mechanism to determine a fair value for the tokens.

The mechanisms used on the DutchX differ to orderbook-based exchanges. 
The DutchX has a number of inherent benefits for high volume traders. Check out some details in this slidedeck:
