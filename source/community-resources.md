# Community Resources


The DutchX is not just another trading platform, but an open trading protocol that anyone can build on. In order to keep this spirit of interactive use, we have a series of communication channels so you can contribute, build your own use case, and stay up to date on our latest news.


#### Developer Incentivisation

The DutchX protocol provides a lot of cool features and intrinsic motivation for traders, devs and projects to be integrating. However, to kick-start, we are not only taking part in [hackathons](https://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hackathons.html), we have also developed a few incentive programs. Check out:
- [Bounties on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/profile/GnosisEcosystemFund) - note that only some are DutchX related.
