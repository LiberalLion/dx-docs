# dxDAO
The dxDAO will be a community-governed DAO with total control over the DutchX trading protocol. Anyone can participate in what will be the first ever fully decentralized trading protocol. The dxDAO is not a Gnosis DAO. No reputation has been pre-allocated and Gnosis will not participate in this initial reputation distribution.
